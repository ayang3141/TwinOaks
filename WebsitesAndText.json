learn how to bring their ideas to life                     our unique and multi-award-winning methodology:   In 1 Academic Year:                STEP 1: IDEA  \u2248 PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN invent their Dream Machine         STEP 2: CONCEPT  \u2248 Higher Education Students  design a Concept         STEP 3: PROTOTYPE  \u2248 Technical Secondary Students  build a Working Prototype                  More On Our Unique Approach               Whether you want to solve a challenge in your job or\u00a0neighbourhood, create something fun, start your own company or whether you want to come up with a solution for something personal or a global issue, all require bold action to bring your idea to life \u00a0This is where (in the words of Harvard University) MyMachine delivers the \u201cI can do that\u201d perspective to all participants                 Students learn that having ideas is important  That you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to express your ideas -even if they sound a bit weird or challenging in the beginning  They learn what it takes to bring an idea to life; and that you can do it by respecting each other\u2019s talents, co-create, collaborate and being persistent and resilient;      Educators experience the power of project based learning \u00a0They participate in an open education process that proves to students that what happens in a classroom can impact the -and has a link to- the real world  That\u2019s the pivotal moment they realise that MyMachine \u2013 and thus education \u2013 brings them skills they can use for life                 Our Communities recognise\u00a0that\u00a0we build creative confidence in students (primary, secondary and higher education) to become the change makers of their own lives, of their communities, and the world at large  We bring these young people a growth mindset allowing them to dream and think bigger, and becoming better in who they are  Because the best version of yourself is the best tool you have to being a contributing team-player to the human race  And we need a lot of strong team-players since we face exigent concerns  The global challenges we face can\u2019t be won by some individual efforts  From climate change to inequality, from global health to poverty, these are all areas that require collective, long-term responses  The biggest tool we have to turn this into success is education  But we need to change how we define success at school because that shapes students\u2019 mindsets and behaviours for the rest of their lives  We know that taking their \u2018dream machine\u2019-ideas seriously means the world to all participating children  Wherever life takes them, dance, engineering, plumbing, IT, fashion, law, filmmaking, management, community building, or space technology, one of the most instrumental skills to bring you happiness and to make you thrive, is learning that you can bring any idea to life  No matter the scope of your vision, whether it\u2019s something personal, local, or global, making it happen starts with the creative confidence that your ideas matter, that your ideas can make a difference  That is how we enable young people to drive their own future, and helping them to become self-motivated, thriving, creative, problem solvers, artists, innovators, entrepreneurs or creators  That is how we will see a lot more of us doing a lot more to shape this better future, we all need to design together    And the best part of it: it\u2019s crazy fun!The Challenge We\u2019re Addressing                                 MyMachine is Endorsed by (a

groundbreaking ideas and turn them into tangible new products and services  Students learn that every idea matters if you want to contribute to innovation  And they learn to do so through collaboration and by respecting each other\u2019s talents  Exactly like they will need to to do in their future jobs \"\"Because the children really are the \u201cbosses,\u201d MyMachine can teach us

education institutions such as schools and colleges still propagate, has caused much harm and despair for young people all around the world  Instead of enabling children and youth to discover and develop their own interests, talents, dreams and aspirations, mainstream education assumes that its students need to be fed with a standardised, abstract, pre-given set of knowledge  This knowledge, it is assumed, will make students into productive, obedient, and thus efficient workers and labourers, who keep the economy going and find their pre-destined place and role in society  At Project DEFY, a holistic education organisation based in Bengaluru, India, we don\u2019t think that any human beings, young or old, are \u201cempty vessels\u201d  We believe that everyone has their own skills, talents and dreams that are waiting to be unleashed  Based on the principles of experiential learning and a self-designed education, our \u201cNook\u201d learning spaces enable everyone to find their calling and chase their dreams    Learn more        \u201cWe believe that traditional education models are actively blocking learning, by ignoring the learners\u2019 personal needs and interests because the education system was designed for the sole purpose of creating like-minded, like-behaving, unquestioning factory workers  The result  A world where all we care about is getting a job, building a house, owning a car while we continuously contribute to or ignore problems that surround us  Classrooms did not exist 400 years ago  They will not exist a 100 years from now \u201d

science lessons and how they can be used with the many different interests and studies of our school  \u2013 Sara Reichstadt, Kinderberry Hill, USA            I love the program and think it\u2019s a game changer!\u2013 Nyla Khan, Co-founder, Kids World Nurseries            Well designed teacher training which you can complete online  Also there are  well-prepared lesson plans with interesting characters: it makes science FUN to learn  \u2013 Olli Kamunen, Northedu, Finland            I like the research-based concept that combines science, art, literacy, and I love the novel assessment methodology of the young scientists  \u2013 Jadesola Adedeji, CEO of STEM METS, Nigeria            The lesson plans are broken down so well, making it seamless for our teachers to execute a session  - Ritika Shah, Founder of Fable Street, India                      \t\t\tCan I teach Kide lessons if I'm not a teacher  \t\t  Of course!In fact, it's one of our points of pride that you don't need to be a) a science teacher or b) a teacher at all to teach Kide lessons  All activities come with ready-made lesson frameworks, pedagogical\u00a0tips and tricks, tips for adjusting to different age groups, scientific explanations, and training materials \u00a0 Each lesson is tried and tested with real kids in the real classroom so you don't need to worry about whether it's going to work \u2013 because it will!How can a lesson be appropriate for ages 3-8  That\u2019s a really big age gap   \t\t  You're right!And we don't expect you to give the exact same lesson to every age group  Each experiment comes with pedagogical tips to tailor the lesson to your respective age groups  Take the action of measuring flowers, for example:\u00a0  It's the same task, but the super young scientists (Level 1) use a totally different method to measure flowers (by easing into the concept with something easy - like a finger) - whereas the older scientists use something concrete, like inches or centimeters      \t\t\tCan I teach Kide lessons online  \t\t  Yes - our lessons are super accessible online  If you'd like to read more about making lessons remote friendly,\u00a0click here \u00a0     \t\t\tDo I need a science kit or special supplies  \t\t  You won't need one!We thoughtfully designed every lesson to use common kitchen supplies only  And hey - if you don't have something: we also often list alternatives \u00a0     \t\t\tIs Kide Science free  \t\t  Currently, we offer a free trial with 6 free lessons of your choice and a free certification course  In addition, we offer monthly and yearly subscriptions that are great for homeschooling parents (unlimited monthly lessons)  If you're teacher, we recommend starting with a monthly subscription or introducing Kide Science program to your principal      \t\t\tWhich curriculums does this match  \t\t  Currently, we support the following US & UK curriculums: EYFS (UK), Key Stage 1 (UK), NGSS (US), Pre-K Standards (US, Iowa) \u00a0Read more here      \t\t\tIs this for kids or adults  \t\t  Both!Kids will learn problem solving skills and science process skills while having fun, and as an educator, you will get to observe how story-based education keeps your your children more engaged and focused at the task at hand (which is why teachers of special needs kids love us!)What topics do you cover  \t\t  Our main topics are Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math \u2013 or STEAM!However, our ultimate goal is to give children critical thinking and problem solving skills they very much need to navigate the world growing up and all of our activities promote the learning of those      \t\t\tDoes this take a lot of preparation  \t\t  No it doesn't  In fact - our introductory lessons can be done right away with very basic supplies you already have on hand (like pens)  On average, it takes about 15-20 minutes\u00a0 to prepare \u2013 including getting familiar with the lesson outline, collecting supplies, and printing out needed materials, after which you're 100% ready to do the lesson      \t\t\tHow is Kide Science different from other STEM resources I already use  \t\t  Short answer:\u00a0Kide Science is story-based,\u00a0which is guaranteed to generate more engagement and get better learning results than normal STEM programs  Longer answer:\u00a0Our scientific research shows that kids learn better when they're playing and using their natural sense of wonder  That's why every Kide Science lesson starts with a story from an imaginary world  Stories and illustrations engage children and present research problems in a concrete,\u00a0fun way - which is much more effective than science lessons with no context                  The best STE(A)M activities for educators and their little scientists  Whether you\u2019re a teacher on the lookout for the best lesson plans out there, or the parent of a curious kid in need of some extra mental stimulation, we\u2019re confident you\u2019ll love our

TalkAbout news literacyMeet the teamNewsResourcesEventsDONATEImpactImpact reportsCase studiesContactContact usSupport us   We are The Economist Educational FoundationAn independent charity that leverages the journalistic expertise of The Economist newspaper What we doWe enable inspiring discussions about the news in, and between, schools  Discussions that invite young people to be curious about the world\u2019s biggest ideas and challenges, and consider what should be done about them Why we do itJoining these discussions inspires young people to think big about the world and their possibilities in it  Just as importantly, it builds essential knowledge of current affairs, critical thinking, communication skills and confidence These news literacy capabilities can help to change a young person\u2019s life  They\u2019re hugely valuable socially, in education, in the workplace and in public life  They're increasingly important for thriving in the modern world Our priority is to work with those young people who most need these capabilities  Young people from low income backgrounds do not have equal opportunities to succeed in education and beyond  They are likely to fall significantly behind in school  They're likely to be worse affected than their peers by the social, political and economic issues in the news  So they have the most to gain by developing news literacy capabilities that can help them to understand and respond to the issues affecting their lives, and to achieve their goals at school and in the wider world That's why our mission is to tackle inequality by giving disadvantaged young people the skills to think for themselves about current affairs The urgent importance of news literacyThe digital media landscape presents an overwhelming amount of information, including plenty that is misleading or one-sided News literacy capabilities are needed to navigate this environment and form an accurate, complete picture of the world  Young people are not developing the critical literacy skills they need: only 2% of young people have the skills to know whether a news story is real or fake The next generation will face huge global and local challenges  We need to ensure young people are able to understand a complex world and have the kind of dialogues that can make it better, for themselves and others There is a huge gap between the \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have-nots\u2019 in the UK and globally We need to make sure that young people who might be negatively affected by issues in the news have opportunities to understand them and have their say Get involvedTopical Talk gives you free teaching resources for weekly classroom discussion  Our adaptable activities help the news make sense for learners aged 9+ LEARN

Diana Award previously teamed up with Vodafone to create the Be Strong Online Ambassadors Programme as part of The Diana Award Anti-Bullying Campaign  Whilst we do not currently train young people to become Be Strong Online Ambassadors, we recognise that young people are the best agents for change in their schools and communities particularly when it comes to the online world  Therefore, we have continued to make these modules available for any young person to use and deliver to their peers   We do still continue to train young people to become Anti-Bullying Ambassadors as part of our Anti-Bullying Campaign  If you\u2019re interested in finding out more, check out our training page here  The Be Strong Online modules cover everything from gaming and selfies to privacy, apps and social networking  These modules have been designed to be led by young people for young people as part of a team in a school or youth setting and empower them to deliver to deliver short sessions to their peers on digital issues  Young people are given the skills and confidence to promote positive digital online behaviour amongst their peers and other young people The modules are still available here to use and download \u00a0     What does \u2018peer-led\u2019 mean   Be Strong Online uses a peer-to-peer model: this means that instead of adults teaching young people, it is young people who teach their peers (people in their school or youth group) by leading short digital skills and awareness sessions from our modules  We recognise that young people are the best agents for change in their schools and communities and are best placed to help their peers learn about the online world  Teachers, educators and youth group leaders can help enable this peer-led model by bringing together teams of young people and supporting their delivery efforts      What is a Be Strong Online Ambassador   The role of a Be Strong Online Ambassador was to raise awareness of digital issues and promote positive digital online behaviour  With the help of their staff leader and team members, they ran short, engaging digital skills and awareness sessions teaching their peers about how to Be Strong Online  Whilst we do not currently train young people to become Be Strong Online Ambassadors, we recognise that young people are the best agents for change in their schools and communities particularly when it comes to the online world  Therefore, we have continued to make our modules available for any young person to use and still suggest that these modules are delivered by young people for young people \u00a0 Does your school or youth setting already have an existing youth-led initiative in place such as mentoring or buddy system or a school council  Then why not use our modules that contain everything you need to deliver short sessions to your peers on topics such as \u2018Selfies and Self-Esteem\u2019 and \u2018Digital Detox-ing\u2019      Can I be an Ambassador if I don\u2019t know much about the 10 modules   \t\t\t\t\tYES!Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know much about the module topics \u00a0 The module lesson plans contain all the information you need on how to deliver the topic to your peers  The modules guide you through how to run each activity step by step  We even have instructional videos for you to watch to make sure you feel confident before delivering your first session  \t\t\t\t    How can I learn more about the 10 modules   There are ten modules in the Be Strong Online platform which aim to cover all aspects of our digital lives  Find out about the modules and download the resources you\u2019ll need by checking out the module page      How do the short Be Strong Online sessions work   With the help of a staff member or youth group leader, young people select one of our 10 modules that they want to deliver to their peers  \u00a0After learning about the topic on the online platform and completing some practice training sessions, young people run short 20 minutes sessions with groups of their peers  Each module follows this format:  Intro Discussion about the topic (video) One 10 minute activity out of a choice of four Wrap-up, hand out follow-up activity sheet and info sheets for students and parents      Is the Be Strong Online programme currently running  \/ How can I get involved    After much success, partnership funding for the Be Strong Online programme sadly ended in 2019  Whilst we are no longer able to train young people to become Be Strong Online Ambassadors, we have made our modules still available to download and use  If you may know a potential funder or may be interested in funding the Be Strong Online programme, get in touch  To get a feel for what a Be Strong Online Ambassador

who have a duty of care to our children: \u201chow can it be deemed compulsory for a child to learn mathematics, but it is optional for that child to learn how to value another human being or to lead

Cerebral development focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on the academic content of curriculum  There is a strong emphasis on developing and enhancing the learners\u2019 abilities in the three languages- English, Dzongkha and Mathematics  The content used in the learning experiences for the three languages will be drawn from the other domain areas such as Life Science, Sports, Aesthetics and Computer Science  With a wide range of new knowledge emerging constantly and the increased accessibility of this knowledge to learners, it is no longer enough to simply learn static concepts  What is ever more important today is the process of learning and the acquisition of skills and abilities to interpret and critically analyse both pre-existing and new knowledge and its application in real-time  Therefore, a focus of cerebral development at The Royal Academy is creating opportunities for learners to develop Skills and Processes, and to engage their curiosity and creativity                          Emotional Development           Emotional development at The Royal Academy focuses on emotional well-being of learners  It offers opportunities to help build the learners ability to recognise their own emotions, understand the external and internal factors that influence them and regulate emotions positively  The Royal Academy will create a safe environment for all learners to express themselves and experience a range of emotions  The priority is on providing a nurturing environment and the essential skills for all learners to discover, explore and continuously develop their potential                          Physical Development           Physical development at The Royal Academy ensures the general well-being, health, hygiene and physical fitness of all learners  Through physical activities such as games and sports, there will be opportunities for learners to build on and improve their physical health and fitness  Learners will be provided with experiences to enhance their interactions with the community and environment  Through games and sports, students will value the spirit of collaboration, leadership and communication                          Social Development           Social development at The Royal Academy focuses on developing wholesome relationships with peers, adults, community and the environment  Social Development aspires to help learners become a person of substance, one who is open to ideas, has the willingness to change, is a trustworthy member of a community and someone who conducts herself with integrity at all times  The choices that the learners make should help them become a responsible, contributory member of a just and harmonious society                          Spiritual Development           Spirituality is used to describe a wide range of ideas, from personal belief in a cosmic existence to subjective experience of profound connection with the universe  At The Royal Academy, it refers to the idea of mindfulness and interconnectedness  Buddhist concepts will form a crucial basis for this aspect of development but there will be a conscious effort to explore beyond the philosophical and religious aspects of Buddhism  Finding joy in every experience and understanding the essence of compassion and empathy will guide the experiences and learning  Therefore, Spiritual Development at The Royal Academy aspires to ensure that each learner becomes the best that they can be for the benefit of individuals and the community                                              The Royal Academy His

neuroscience, MindUP teaches the skills and knowledge children need to regulate their stress and emotion, form positive relationships, and act with kindness and compassion  Our Mission         When I began The Goldie Hawn Foundation in 2003 I knew that I had to do something to remedy the stress and anxiety children were experiencing  Every child deserves an equal chance to thrive, and so together with researchers, scientists, and educators I created the MindUP program  \u2014 Goldie Hawn, Founder of the Goldie Hawn Foundation         We foster children\u2019s well-being through educational

way of being \u201d Sam Goodlad, Principal, Australia     \u201cReal world, every day experiences helped students understand the difference between mindful and unmindful  Examples like holding the door for someone at Wawa got students thinking about times they have experienced people being unmindful or they have been unmindful themselves \u201d Eighth Grade Teacher     \u201cMy fourth grade class loved the mindful smelling activities!We took the opportunity to share connections we have made to places or experiences from simple scents  Many of the kids shared smells from their grandparents\u2019 houses, seasonal activities, etc  I was impressed with the dialogue that took place after the \u2018secret smelling\u2019 activity that we did!\u201d Fourth Grade Teacher     \u201cI think the lessons have been going super!The kids are using the brain language and understanding the function of the three parts  For example, we talk about calming our amygdala after lunch and recess  I have heard them using the terms in their everyday talk  So far it is going really great  I don\u2019t have anything that hasn\u2019t worked yet \u201d Kindergarten Teacher     \u201cMindUp provides consistent and ongoing opportunities for students to practice their social emotional learning skills  As a CASEL SELect program it has extensive research to back its effectiveness \u201d Jane Tasker     \u201cSocial emotional learning is as important for students as academic learning  The MindUP Curriculum beautifully combines both by teaching our students about their brains while they learn important skills that create joyful and harmonious classrooms \u201d Rita D  Perez     \u201cOne of my pupils was suffering from depression  He\u2019d never has a friend due to some language

opportunity to have a wonderful Syrian conversation partner that not only shares his language with me, but also his personal interests and history as a Syrian in Lebanon  This project is not simply about language exchange, it is a bridge connecting two cultures  Something we are so dramatically in need these days!Sara, Australia (Integrated curriculum student)  I recommend NaTakallam to everyone I hear say they have an interest in learning Arabic--not only is the program solid and the materials helpful, but also my Conversation Partner is both teacher and friend  I'm really grateful for the experience                            Seda, Turkey (Spanish learner)   I am having Spanish classes and very excited to continue with my conversation partner\/teacher Marianela!This is a great platform

the service!I was an Arabic major in college and got a masters at the American University of Cairo, but that was about 7 years ago, and I was rusty  My tutor was able to match my level and tailor the curriculum around what I'm interested in (improving my spoken Egyptian dialect and my pronunciation)  I also use Natakallam for Spanish, and I have the same positive review!Karine, France    The Integrated Curriculum program has been the perfect fit for me to start learning Arabic  I am currently working in a war zone (non-Arabic speaking) and travelling a lot  Thanks to the program I have been able to learn some basics in the Arabic language  Furthermore, the encouragement and patience of my tutor has played a big role in keeping me motivated  I am very thankful to this program and my tutor and I am always looking for my next class                            Jennifer, Australia    I recommend NaTakallam to everyone I hear say they have an interest in learning Arabic \u2013 not only

have been practicing my Spanish through Natakallam for 5 months now and highly recommend it  My fluency quickly improved and the human experience of getting to know my teacher and exchanging perspectives on life while conversing in Spanish has been very enriching  I'm really grateful to Natakallam for pairing us together                            Daniel, USA   NaTakallam is a really excellent initiative  The West is filled with students learning Arabic but lacking exposure to Arabic life, culture, and people  We are taught to speak formally about the United Nations, but can\u2019t hold a conversation about daily life  NaTakallam gives Arabic students unique access to the Arabic-speaking world  More importantly, speaking with refugees who are fleeing extreme violence can teach sheltered Western students some degree of humility and compassion as they study the abstract \u2018Arab world\u2019  It\u2019s a beautiful program, and I\u2019ve actively encouraged all of my colleagues to sign up                             Mother of Young Students, USA (Arabic learners)  This is a wonderful opportunity to get our daughters to practice, given that we live in NY and that they are only in Lebanon one month a year  Their conversation partner was professional, knowledgeable and friendly, and knowing that this service helps her in her difficult situation makes it a win-win on both sides  Many thanks to the Natakallam team!I am having Spanish classes and very excited to continue with my conversation partner\/teacher Marianela!This is a great platform to connect

positive review!USA (Arabic & Spanish learner)Spenser        NaTakallam is a really excellent initiative  The West is filled with students learning Arabic but lacking exposure to Arabic life, culture, and people  We are taught to speak formally about the United Nations, but can\u2019t hold a conversation about daily life  NaTakallam gives Arabic students unique access to the Arabic-speaking world  More importantly, speaking with refugees who are fleeing extreme violence can teach sheltered Western students some degree of humility and compassion as they study the abstract \u2018Arab world\u2019  It\u2019s a beautiful program, and I\u2019ve actively encouraged all of my colleagues to sign up     USADaniel        The Integrated Curriculum program has been the perfect fit for me to start learning Arabic  I am currently working in a war zone (non-Arabic speaking) and travelling a lot  Thanks to the program I have been able to learn some basics in the Arabic language  Furthermore, the encouragement and patience of my tutor has played a big role in keeping me motivated  I am very thankful to this program and my tutor and I am always looking for my next class     FranceKarine

About Us                   Project FUEL, founded in 2009 by Deepak Ramola, collects life                 lessons from people all over the world and turns them into                 interactive and performance activities, to pass on the                 learnings  The passing on happens by way of workshops,                 seminars, and sometimes even over coffee                                  Every life is important and so is what each person's life                 teaches them  At FUEL, life lessons are continuously                 collected, documented, thought about deeply and then turned                 into performance activities  This ensures that you don't just                 hear someone's lesson in words but experience it tangibly, and                 apply it practically in your own life  The organization seeks                 to build a community of young adults who live, learn and share                 in order to make meaningful psycho-social and emotional                 contribution to their lives, and the society at large                                  A life lesson that comes to us from another human being can                 shine light on the understanding of our own life  Hence the                 name FUEL, which stands for Forward the Understanding of Every                 Life Lesson                         Project FUEL - The Story

Prototype                  More On Our Unique Approach               Whether you want to solve a challenge in your job or\u00a0neighbourhood, create something fun, start your own company or whether you want to come up with a solution for something personal or a global issue, all require bold action to bring your idea to life \u00a0This is where (in the words of Harvard University) MyMachine delivers the \u201cI can do that\u201d perspective to all participants                 Students learn that having ideas is important  That you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to express your ideas -even if they sound a bit weird or challenging in the beginning  They learn what it takes to bring an idea to life; and that you can do it by respecting each other\u2019s talents, co-create, collaborate and being persistent and resilient;      Educators experience the power of project based learning \u00a0They participate in an open education process that proves to students that what happens in a classroom can impact the -and has a link to- the real world  That\u2019s the pivotal moment they realise that MyMachine \u2013 and thus education \u2013 brings them skills they can use for life                 Our Communities recognise\u00a0that\u00a0we build creative confidence in students (primary, secondary and higher education) to become the change makers of their own lives, of their communities, and the world at large  We bring these young people a growth mindset allowing them to dream and think bigger, and becoming better in who they are  Because the best version of yourself is the best tool you have to being a contributing team-player to the human race  And we need a lot of strong team-players since we face exigent concerns  The global challenges we face can\u2019t be won by some individual efforts  From climate change to inequality, from global health to poverty, these are all areas that require collective, long-term responses  The biggest tool we have to turn this into success is education  But we need to change how we define success at school because that shapes students\u2019 mindsets and behaviours for the rest of their lives  We know that taking their \u2018dream machine\u2019-ideas seriously means the world to all participating children  Wherever life takes them, dance, engineering, plumbing, IT, fashion, law, filmmaking, management, community building, or space technology, one of the most instrumental skills to bring you happiness and to make you thrive, is learning that you can bring any idea to life  No matter the scope of your vision, whether it\u2019s something personal, local, or global, making it happen starts with the creative confidence that your ideas matter, that your ideas can make a difference  That is how we enable young people to drive their own future, and helping them to become self-motivated, thriving, creative, problem solvers, artists, innovators, entrepreneurs or creators  That is how we will see a lot more of us doing a lot more to shape this better future, we all need to design together    And the best part of it: it\u2019s crazy fun!The Challenge We\u2019re Addressing

education institutions such as schools and colleges still propagate, has caused much harm and despair for young people all around the world  Instead of enabling children and youth to discover and develop their own interests, talents, dreams and aspirations, mainstream education assumes that its students need to be fed with a standardised, abstract, pre-given set of knowledge  This knowledge, it is assumed, will make students into productive, obedient, and thus efficient workers and labourers, who keep the economy going and find their pre-destined place and role in society  At Project DEFY, a holistic education organisation based in Bengaluru, India, we don\u2019t think that any human beings, young or old, are \u201cempty vessels\u201d  We believe that everyone has their own skills, talents and dreams that are waiting to be unleashed  Based on the principles of experiential learning and a self-designed education, our \u201cNook\u201d learning spaces enable everyone to find their calling and chase their dreams    Learn more        \u201cWe believe that traditional education models are actively blocking learning, by ignoring the learners\u2019 personal needs and interests because the education system was designed for the sole purpose of creating like-minded, like-behaving, unquestioning factory workers  The result  A world where all we care about is getting a job, building a house, owning a car while we continuously contribute to or ignore problems that surround us  Classrooms did not exist 400 years ago  They will not exist a 100 years from now \u201d

effort has been made to make the teachers job easier  Kide Science lessons  follow a story with characters which makes my students feel more involved and proud of their accomplishments as they feel

science lessons and how they can be used with the many different interests and studies of our school  \u2013 Sara Reichstadt, Kinderberry Hill, USA            I love the program and think it\u2019s a game changer!\u2013 Nyla Khan, Co-founder, Kids World Nurseries            Well designed teacher training which you can complete online  Also there are  well-prepared lesson plans with interesting characters: it makes science FUN to learn  \u2013 Olli Kamunen, Northedu, Finland            I like the research-based concept that combines science, art, literacy, and I love the novel assessment methodology of the young scientists  \u2013 Jadesola Adedeji, CEO of STEM METS, Nigeria            The lesson plans are broken down so well, making it seamless for our teachers to execute a session  - Ritika Shah, Founder of Fable Street, India                      \t\t\tCan I teach Kide lessons if I'm not a teacher  \t\t  Of course!In fact, it's one of our points of pride that you don't need to be a) a science teacher or b) a teacher at all to teach Kide lessons  All activities come with ready-made lesson frameworks, pedagogical\u00a0tips and tricks, tips for adjusting to different age groups, scientific explanations, and training materials \u00a0 Each lesson is tried and tested with real kids in the real classroom so you don't need to worry about whether it's going to work \u2013 because it will!How can a lesson be appropriate for ages 3-8  That\u2019s a really big age gap   \t\t  You're right!And we don't expect you to give the exact same lesson to every age group  Each experiment comes with pedagogical tips to tailor the lesson to your respective age groups  Take the action of measuring flowers, for example:\u00a0  It's the same task, but the super young scientists (Level 1) use a totally different method to measure flowers (by easing into the concept with something easy - like a finger) - whereas the older scientists use something concrete, like inches or centimeters      \t\t\tCan I teach Kide lessons online  \t\t  Yes - our lessons are super accessible online  If you'd like to read more about making lessons remote friendly,\u00a0click here \u00a0     \t\t\tDo I need a science kit or special supplies  \t\t  You won't need one!We thoughtfully designed every lesson to use common kitchen supplies only  And hey - if you don't have something: we also often list alternatives \u00a0     \t\t\tIs Kide Science free  \t\t  Currently, we offer a free trial with 6 free lessons of your choice and a free certification course  In addition, we offer monthly and yearly subscriptions that are great for homeschooling parents (unlimited monthly lessons)  If you're teacher, we recommend starting with a monthly subscription or introducing Kide Science program to your principal      \t\t\tWhich curriculums does this match  \t\t  Currently, we support the following US & UK curriculums: EYFS (UK), Key Stage 1 (UK), NGSS (US), Pre-K Standards (US, Iowa) \u00a0Read more here      \t\t\tIs this for kids or adults  \t\t  Both!Kids will learn problem solving skills and science process skills while having fun, and as an educator, you will get to observe how story-based education keeps your your children more engaged and focused at the task at hand (which is why teachers of special needs kids love us!)What topics do you cover  \t\t  Our main topics are Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math \u2013 or STEAM!However, our ultimate goal is to give children critical thinking and problem solving skills they very much need to navigate the world growing up and all of our activities promote the learning of those      \t\t\tDoes this take a lot of preparation  \t\t  No it doesn't  In fact - our introductory lessons can be done right away with very basic supplies you already have on hand (like pens)  On average, it takes about 15-20 minutes\u00a0 to prepare \u2013 including getting familiar with the lesson outline, collecting supplies, and printing out needed materials, after which you're 100% ready to do the lesson      \t\t\tHow is Kide Science different from other STEM resources I already use  \t\t  Short answer:\u00a0Kide Science is story-based,\u00a0which is guaranteed to generate more engagement and get better learning results than normal STEM programs  Longer answer:\u00a0Our scientific research shows that kids learn better when they're playing and using their natural sense of wonder  That's why every Kide Science lesson starts with a story from an imaginary world  Stories and illustrations engage children and present research problems in a concrete,\u00a0fun way - which is much more effective than science lessons with no context                  The best STE(A)M activities for educators and their little scientists  Whether you\u2019re a teacher on the lookout for the best lesson plans out there, or the parent of a curious kid in need of some extra mental stimulation, we\u2019re confident you\u2019ll love our

TalkAbout news literacyMeet the teamNewsResourcesEventsDONATEImpactImpact reportsCase studiesContactContact usSupport us   We are The Economist Educational FoundationAn independent charity that leverages the journalistic expertise of The Economist newspaper What we doWe enable inspiring discussions about the news in, and between, schools  Discussions that invite young people to be curious about the world\u2019s biggest ideas and challenges, and consider what should be done about them Why we do itJoining these discussions inspires young people to think big about the world and their possibilities in it  Just as importantly, it builds essential knowledge of current affairs, critical thinking, communication skills and confidence These news literacy capabilities can help to change a young person\u2019s life  They\u2019re hugely valuable socially, in education, in the workplace and in public life  They're increasingly important for thriving in the modern world Our priority is to work with those young people who most need these capabilities  Young people from low income backgrounds do not have equal opportunities to succeed in education and beyond  They are likely to fall significantly behind in school  They're likely to be worse affected than their peers by the social, political and economic issues in the news  So they have the most to gain by developing news literacy capabilities that can help them to understand and respond to the issues affecting their lives, and to achieve their goals at school and in the wider world That's why our mission is to tackle inequality by giving disadvantaged young people the skills to think for themselves about current affairs The urgent importance of news literacyThe digital media landscape presents an overwhelming amount of information, including plenty that is misleading or one-sided News literacy capabilities are needed to navigate this environment and form an accurate, complete picture of the world  Young people are not developing the critical literacy skills they need: only 2% of young people have the skills to know whether a news story is real or fake The next generation will face huge global and local challenges  We need to ensure young people are able to understand a complex world and have the kind of dialogues that can make it better, for themselves and others There is a huge gap between the \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have-nots\u2019 in the UK and globally We need to make sure that young people who might be negatively affected by issues in the news have opportunities to understand them and have their say Get involvedTopical Talk gives you free teaching resources for weekly classroom discussion  Our adaptable activities help the news make sense for learners aged 9+ LEARN

Diana Award previously teamed up with Vodafone to create the Be Strong Online Ambassadors Programme as part of The Diana Award Anti-Bullying Campaign  Whilst we do not currently train young people to become Be Strong Online Ambassadors, we recognise that young people are the best agents for change in their schools and communities particularly when it comes to the online world  Therefore, we have continued to make these modules available for any young person to use and deliver to their peers   We do still continue to train young people to become Anti-Bullying Ambassadors as part of our Anti-Bullying Campaign  If you\u2019re interested in finding out more, check out our training page here  The Be Strong Online modules cover everything from gaming and selfies to privacy, apps and social networking  These modules have been designed to be led by young people for young people as part of a team in a school or youth setting and empower them to deliver to deliver short sessions to their peers on digital issues  Young people are given the skills and confidence to promote positive digital online behaviour amongst their peers and other young people The modules are still available here to use and download \u00a0     What does \u2018peer-led\u2019 mean   Be Strong Online uses a peer-to-peer model: this means that instead of adults teaching young people, it is young people who teach their peers (people in their school or youth group) by leading short digital skills and awareness sessions from our modules  We recognise that young people are the best agents for change in their schools and communities and are best placed to help their peers learn about the online world  Teachers, educators and youth group leaders can help enable this peer-led model by bringing together teams of young people and supporting their delivery efforts      What is a Be Strong Online Ambassador   The role of a Be Strong Online Ambassador was to raise awareness of digital issues and promote positive digital online behaviour  With the help of their staff leader and team members, they ran short, engaging digital skills and awareness sessions teaching their peers about how to Be Strong Online  Whilst we do not currently train young people to become Be Strong Online Ambassadors, we recognise that young people are the best agents for change in their schools and communities particularly when it comes to the online world  Therefore, we have continued to make our modules available for any young person to use and still suggest that these modules are delivered by young people for young people \u00a0 Does your school or youth setting already have an existing youth-led initiative in place such as mentoring or buddy system or a school council  Then why not use our modules that contain everything you need to deliver short sessions to your peers on topics such as \u2018Selfies and Self-Esteem\u2019 and \u2018Digital Detox-ing\u2019      Can I be an Ambassador if I don\u2019t know much about the 10 modules   \t\t\t\t\tYES!Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know much about the module topics \u00a0 The module lesson plans contain all the information you need on how to deliver the topic to your peers  The modules guide you through how to run each activity step by step  We even have instructional videos for you to watch to make sure you feel confident before delivering your first session  \t\t\t\t    How can I learn more about the 10 modules   There are ten modules in the Be Strong Online platform which aim to cover all aspects of our digital lives  Find out about the modules and download the resources you\u2019ll need by checking out the module page      How do the short Be Strong Online sessions work   With the help of a staff member or youth group leader, young people select one of our 10 modules that they want to deliver to their peers  \u00a0After learning about the topic on the online platform and completing some practice training sessions, young people run short 20 minutes sessions with groups of their peers  Each module follows this format:  Intro Discussion about the topic (video) One 10 minute activity out of a choice of four Wrap-up, hand out follow-up activity sheet and info sheets for students and parents      Is the Be Strong Online programme currently running  \/ How can I get involved    After much success, partnership funding for the Be Strong Online programme sadly ended in 2019  Whilst we are no longer able to train young people to become Be Strong Online Ambassadors, we have made our modules still available to download and use  If you may know a potential funder or may be interested in funding the Be Strong Online programme, get in touch  To get a feel for what a Be Strong Online Ambassador

who have a duty of care to our children: \u201chow can it be deemed compulsory for a child to learn mathematics, but it is optional for that child to learn how to value another human being or to lead

Cerebral development focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on the academic content of curriculum  There is a strong emphasis on developing and enhancing the learners\u2019 abilities in the three languages- English, Dzongkha and Mathematics  The content used in the learning experiences for the three languages will be drawn from the other domain areas such as Life Science, Sports, Aesthetics and Computer Science  With a wide range of new knowledge emerging constantly and the increased accessibility of this knowledge to learners, it is no longer enough to simply learn static concepts  What is ever more important today is the process of learning and the acquisition of skills and abilities to interpret and critically analyse both pre-existing and new knowledge and its application in real-time  Therefore, a focus of cerebral development at The Royal Academy is creating opportunities for learners to develop Skills and Processes, and to engage their curiosity and creativity                          Emotional Development           Emotional development at The Royal Academy focuses on emotional well-being of learners  It offers opportunities to help build the learners ability to recognise their own emotions, understand the external and internal factors that influence them and regulate emotions positively  The Royal Academy will create a safe environment for all learners to express themselves and experience a range of emotions  The priority is on providing a nurturing environment and the essential skills for all learners to discover, explore and continuously develop their potential                          Physical Development           Physical development at The Royal Academy ensures the general well-being, health, hygiene and physical fitness of all learners  Through physical activities such as games and sports, there will be opportunities for learners to build on and improve their physical health and fitness  Learners will be provided with experiences to enhance their interactions with the community and environment  Through games and sports, students will value the spirit of collaboration, leadership and communication                          Social Development           Social development at The Royal Academy focuses on developing wholesome relationships with peers, adults, community and the environment  Social Development aspires to help learners become a person of substance, one who is open to ideas, has the willingness to change, is a trustworthy member of a community and someone who conducts herself with integrity at all times  The choices that the learners make should help them become a responsible, contributory member of a just and harmonious society                          Spiritual Development           Spirituality is used to describe a wide range of ideas, from personal belief in a cosmic existence to subjective experience of profound connection with the universe  At The Royal Academy, it refers to the idea of mindfulness and interconnectedness  Buddhist concepts will form a crucial basis for this aspect of development but there will be a conscious effort to explore beyond the philosophical and religious aspects of Buddhism  Finding joy in every experience and understanding the essence of compassion and empathy will guide the experiences and learning  Therefore, Spiritual Development at The Royal Academy aspires to ensure that each learner becomes the best that they can be for the benefit of individuals and the community                                              The Royal Academy His

Foundation     We believe that our young people deserve an inclusive world of kindness, love, joy, respect, equality and one that promotes interconnectivity to all humanity  Based firmly in neuroscience, MindUP teaches the skills and knowledge children need to regulate their stress and emotion, form positive relationships, and act with kindness and compassion  Our Mission         When I began The Goldie Hawn Foundation in 2003 I knew that I had to do something to remedy the stress and anxiety children were experiencing  Every child deserves an equal chance to thrive, and so together with researchers, scientists, and educators I created the MindUP program  \u2014 Goldie Hawn, Founder of the Goldie Hawn Foundation         We foster children\u2019s well-being through educational programs based in:    Neuroscience    Mindful Awareness    Positive Psychology    Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)         Evidence Evidence indicates MindUP\u2019s positive impact on a range of measures:    86%  Children report being able to boost their well-being by using MindUP     88%  Children who, after learning MindUP, use it at home     83%  Children indicate improvements in

way of being \u201d Sam Goodlad, Principal, Australia     \u201cReal world, every day experiences helped students understand the difference between mindful and unmindful  Examples like holding the door for someone at Wawa got students thinking about times they have experienced people being unmindful or they have been unmindful themselves \u201d Eighth Grade Teacher     \u201cMy fourth grade class loved the mindful smelling activities!We took the opportunity to share connections we have made to places or experiences from simple scents  Many of the kids shared smells from their grandparents\u2019 houses, seasonal activities, etc  I was impressed with the dialogue that took place after the \u2018secret smelling\u2019 activity that we did!\u201d Fourth Grade Teacher     \u201cI think the lessons have been going super!The kids are using the brain language and understanding the function of the three parts  For example, we talk about calming our amygdala after lunch and recess  I have heard them using the terms in their everyday talk  So far it is going really great  I don\u2019t have anything that hasn\u2019t worked yet \u201d Kindergarten Teacher     \u201cMindUp provides consistent and ongoing opportunities for students to practice their social emotional learning skills  As a CASEL SELect program it has extensive research to back its effectiveness \u201d Jane Tasker     \u201cSocial emotional learning is as important for students as academic learning  The MindUP Curriculum beautifully combines both by teaching our students about their brains while they learn important skills that create joyful and harmonious classrooms \u201d Rita D  Perez     \u201cOne of my pupils was suffering from depression  He\u2019d never has a friend due to some language processing problems  During the gratitude practice, he heard how important he was to other boys in the class  The difference was extraordinary, and his parents say he is so much happier and now has

opportunity to have a wonderful Syrian conversation partner that not only shares his language with me, but also his personal interests and history as a Syrian in Lebanon  This project is not simply about language exchange, it is a bridge connecting two cultures  Something we are so dramatically in need these days!Sara, Australia (Integrated curriculum student)  I recommend NaTakallam to everyone I hear say they have an interest in learning Arabic--not only is the program solid and the materials helpful, but also my Conversation Partner is both teacher and friend  I'm really grateful for the

About Us                   Project FUEL, founded in 2009 by Deepak Ramola, collects life                 lessons from people all over the world and turns them into                 interactive and performance activities, to pass on the                 learnings  The passing on happens by way of workshops,                 seminars, and sometimes even over coffee                                  Every life is important and so is what each person's life                 teaches them  At FUEL, life lessons are continuously                 collected, documented, thought about deeply and then turned                 into performance activities  This ensures that you don't just                 hear someone's lesson in words but experience it tangibly, and                 apply it practically in your own life  The organization seeks                 to build a community of young adults who live, learn and share                 in order to make meaningful psycho-social and emotional                 contribution to their lives, and the society at large                                  A life lesson that comes to us from another human being can                 shine light on the understanding of our own life  Hence the                 name FUEL, which stands for Forward the Understanding of Every                 Life Lesson                         Project FUEL - The Story

needed                       exchange of life learnings between extremely diverse                       individuals  Learning from One's mistake and another's                       success story has the potential to transform human                       experience for the better  The power of this mechanism                       on a large scale can change the way we lead our lives

    Project FUEL's first ever tour to Nepal  Like the theme                       of the tour \"Building Brave hearts\" , Deepak and his                       team really brought positivity and smiles to the                       children attending the sessions  Sharing their own life                       lessons and internalizing life lessons of different                       people around the globe through fun games is indeed an                       effective method of learning  \"               Yashraj S  Akashi Senior Ambassador, TEDxIndia  \" The first time I heard about Project FUEL                       and saw it's video I felt a certain connect,                       immediately  I saw it as something that could fill a                       void which is much needed in today\u2019s world; especially                       when people are caught up in meaningless toxic things                        The life lessons of others helps you acknowledge your                       own lessons and walk on a path of clarity  FUEL should                       be a part of every child\u2019s learning process irrespective                       of the age for a sustainable
